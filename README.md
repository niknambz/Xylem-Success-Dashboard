# Xylem-Success-Dashboard
Strategic L&amp;D framework and ROI dashboard designed to transform the Mentor role into a "Student Success Manager." Features predictive sentiment analysis, attrition cost modeling, and operational efficiency tracking.


📊 Student Success Framework: Performance & ROI Dashboard
This repository contains the data infrastructure and interactive dashboard for the Student Success Framework. Designed for the L&D department, this tool transitions traditional mentorship into a data-driven "Student Success Manager" model, focusing on measurable compliance and revenue protection.

🚀 Overview
The Mentor role often suffers from high attrition due to "administrative drag" and unclear career paths. This project provides a technical solution to:

Quantify Attrition: Calculate the fully burdened cost of staff turnover.

Recover Capacity: Identify and eliminate manual administrative "leaks" (averaging 4 hours/day).

Predict Student Churn: Utilize a weighted Student Sentiment Index (SSI) to identify at-risk branches before withdrawals occur.

🛠 Key Metrics & Mathematical Models
Recovered Capacity Ratio: Measuring the shift from admin tasks to active student success management.

Compliance Scorecard: A real-time metric for digital manual adherence.

SSI (Student Sentiment Index): A predictive model based on parent CRM logs and sentiment tagging.

💻 Tech Stack
Language: Python

Framework: Streamlit (Web Interface)

Data Processing: Pandas

📈 Strategic Impact
By implementing this framework, organizations can expect a 10-20% reduction in attrition costs and significantly improved student retention scores through proactive, evidence-based reporting.
